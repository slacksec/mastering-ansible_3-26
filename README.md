# mastering-ansible_3-26
Awesome Udemy class by Chris Lunsford. I use this to keep 'control' under control.
My intent is to use this as a restoral point, as I've had many issues with vagrant ssh.
I've started by adding Lecture 3-26 directory structure, and will update it as I progress.
This lesson directly relates to the project my manager has assigned me at work.
I find this Udemy course a huge plus in understanding the somewhat complex playbook code
